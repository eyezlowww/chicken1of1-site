**The Story Behind Bauk Bauk Baby**

---

## Our Story

Chicken1of1 started in 2021 with streaming UFC breaks to an audience of 12 people. Since then the Chicken1of1 channel has grown to several sports card loving friends running UFC and entertainment card breaks with one simple goal: **have fun while being generous and trustworthy**.

We stream live on Whatnot, with a focus on niche sports and segments like:
- UFC
- Wrestling
- Disney
- Marvel
- Other non-major sport categories

Our approach is straightforward:
- Fair breaks
- Quick and secure shipping
- Lots of Bauking

## Community Philosophy

**"Loitering is welcomed and encouraged in our streams, you do not need to spend to be welcomed or have fun."**

This is a core principle of Chicken1of1. We believe in building a community first, sales second. Our streams are a place to hang out, learn about the hobby, and enjoy the excitement of card breaking - whether you're buying spots or just watching.
