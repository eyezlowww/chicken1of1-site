## General Questions

### What is a card break?
A card break or unboxing is where boxes or cases of trading cards are opened live on stream. Participants buy spots (teams, divisions, serial #, or players) and receive the cards that correspond to their purchase. Breaking is a FUN way to grow your collection, but it isn't the financially smartest way to grow your collection.

### What does Bauk Bauk Baby mean?

## For New Collectors

### Chicken, what words of wisdom do you have for a collector that's new to the hobby?

To get familiar with how the collecting world works, start very small and very focused. Choose a player that you love, bonus points if it's someone whose cards you can purchase for cheap.

**Research Resources**:

### What's the difference between Random Team and Pick Your Team (PYT)?

### What break formats do you offer?

- Pick Your Team (PYT)
- Divisional (by UFC weight class)
- Hit Draft (where hits are drafted in order)
- Custom formats (each format is clearly explained before the break begins)

## Shipping & Delivery

### How long does shipping take?
We typically ship cards within 2 business days after a break is completed. Standard shipping takes 3-7 business days within the US. International shipping is available and takes 7-21 business days depending on the destination.

### Do you ship internationally?
Yes, we ship to most international destinations. Buyers are responsible for any customs duties, taxes, or fees. International shipping costs vary by weight and destination, and delivery times may be affected by customs processing.

### Are base cards included?
Yes, base cards are included in your shipment unless the break is specifically labeled as 'hits only.' Base cards help complete sets and add value to your break participation.

## Refunds & Guarantees

### What if I don't get any good cards?
Card breaking involves chance and luck - there are no guaranteed hits or refunds. Some breaks will have amazing pulls while others may only yield base cards. That's the nature of the hobby and part of the excitement of breaking.

### Can I get a refund if I'm not happy with my cards?
All sales are final once a break has started. We cannot offer refunds based on card values or disappointing pulls, as breaking involves inherent risk and chance. However, we will correct any mistakes in card allocation or shipping errors.

---

## Transparency & Trust

### How do I know which cards are mine?
All breaks are streamed live and recorded for transparency. We clearly announce which cards go to which teams/spots during the break. You'll also receive a break summary with your shipment showing exactly which cards were pulled from which packs.

### Are giveaways really free?
Yes! Our giveaways are completely free to enter with no purchase necessary. We regularly host giveaways on our live streams and social media. Winners are selected randomly and fairly.
