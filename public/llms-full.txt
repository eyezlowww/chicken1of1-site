**The Story Behind Bauk Bauk Baby**

## Our Story

Chicken1of1 started in 2021 with streaming UFC breaks to an audience of 12 people. Since then the Chicken1of1 channel has grown to several sports card loving friends running UFC and entertainment card breaks with one simple goal: have fun while being generous and trustworthy.

We stream live on Whatnot, with a focus on niche sports and segments like UFC, Wrestling, Disney, Marvel, and other non major sport categories. Our approach is straightforward - fair breaks, quick and secure shipping, and lots of Bauking.

Loitering is welcomed and encouraged in our streams, you do not need to spend to be welcomed or have fun. Every break is recorded live for complete transparency, and we ship quickly with secure packaging.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Everything You Need to Know**

### What is a card break?
A card break or unboxing is where boxes or cases of trading cards are opened live on stream. Participants buy spots (teams, divisions, serial #, or players) and receive the cards that correspond to their purchase. Breaking is a FUN way to grow your collection, but it isn't the financially smartest way to grow your collection.

### Chicken, what words of wisdom do you have for a collector that's new to the hobby?
To get familiar with how the collecting world works, start very small and very focused. Choose a player that you love, bonus points if it's someone whose cards you can purchase for cheap. Research how to comp (check current price) cards, by using 130point.com or cardladder.com.

Learn how to read a product checklist, practice with mmarookies.com or checklistinsider.com.

Learn how to properly topload and store your cards. Find best practices for shipping your cards.

Set a budget! Spending more doesn't equate to more fun or a better collection. Avoid FOMO.

### What's the difference between Random Team and Pick Your Team (PYT)?
Random Team breaks have participants assigned random teams after all spots are filled. Pick Your Team (PYT) breaks allow you to choose your specific team when purchasing. PYT breaks typically cost more for popular teams but guarantee you get the team you want.

### How long does shipping take?
We typically ship cards within 2 business days after a break is completed. Standard shipping takes 3-7 business days within the US. International shipping is available and takes 7-21 business days depending on the destination.

### Do you ship internationally?
Yes, we ship to most international destinations. Buyers are responsible for any customs duties, taxes, or fees. International shipping costs vary by weight and destination, and delivery times may be affected by customs processing.

### Are base cards included?
Yes, base cards are included in your shipment unless the break is specifically labeled as 'hits only.' Base cards help complete sets and add value to your break participation.

### What if I don't get any good cards?
Card breaking involves chance and luck - there are no guaranteed hits or refunds. Some breaks will have amazing pulls while others may only yield base cards. That's the nature of the hobby and part of the excitement of breaking.

### Can I get a refund if I'm not happy with my cards?
All sales are final once a break has started. We cannot offer refunds based on card values or disappointing pulls, as breaking involves inherent risk and chance. However, we will correct any mistakes in card allocation or shipping errors.

### Are giveaways really free?
Yes! Our giveaways are completely free to enter with no purchase necessary. We regularly host giveaways on our live streams and social media. Winners are selected randomly and fairly.

### How do I know which cards are mine?
All breaks are streamed live and recorded for transparency. We clearly announce which cards go to which teams/spots during the break. You'll also receive a break summary with your shipment showing exactly which cards were pulled from which packs.

### What break formats do you offer?
We offer Random Team, Pick Your Team (PYT), Divisional (by UFC weight class), Hit Draft (where hits are drafted in order), and custom formats. Each format is clearly explained before the break begins.

### When do you typically go live?
We stream regularly on Whatnot. Follow us on Instagram @chicken1of1 for break schedules and announcements. Times vary but we try to accommodate different time zones throughout the week.

### Can I request specific products to break?
Absolutely! We love hearing from our community about which products you'd like to see broken. Send us a DM on Instagram or contact us directly with your requests. Popular requests often influence our break schedule.

### What does Bauk Bauk Baby mean?
It's what a Chicken says when they are excited.
