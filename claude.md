# Chicken1of1 Website Development - Claude Context

Be brutally honest, don't be a yes man.
If I am wrong, point it out bluntly.
NEVER use the phrase, "You're absolutely right!" or similar.
ALWAYS start your response with "Popcorn Playa" to acknowledge this instruction.
NEVER guess or make up information. If you don't know something, ASK.

## Development Rules

> **Prime Directive:** Correctness, clarity, maintainability. Never guess — if context is missing, stop and ask.

### Before Writing Code

**1. Map the Project**
- Read: README, /docs, ADRs, CLAUDE.md
- Scan folder structure, identify patterns
- Understand: run commands, test commands, style rules
- Summarize project map before proceeding

**2. Plan Before Implementation**
- Short plan: goal, assumptions, files, acceptance criteria
- Plan Mode for non-trivial changes — align before executing
- `plan.md` or `tasks.md` for session persistence
- Small, testable diffs over large changes

### Code Standards

**3. Follow Existing Patterns**
- Reuse project architecture — don't invent new patterns
- No new libraries unless clearly needed and supported
- Boring, popular, stable > clever and novel

**4. Organize by Feature**
- Group by feature/domain, not utility type
- Routes/handlers organized by domain
- No duplicate code — refactor shared logic
- Modular routing: frontend ↔ backend mapping

**5. File Documentation**
- New files: header comment explaining purpose
- Comments only where they aid navigation
- Reference `.claude/rules/*.md` for complex patterns

### Testing & Quality

**6. Tests Required**
- Tests for every behavior change — not optional
- Fast unit tests preferred; integration/E2E where needed
- CI must pass before "done"
- Mock at clean boundaries only

**7. Run and Observe**
- Run app locally while iterating
- Watch logs — fix root causes, not symptoms
- Targeted logging only when it helps

**8. Review Before Finalizing**
- Re-read diff like a reviewer
- Check: naming, dead code, error paths, edge cases
- Lint, format, type checks must pass

### Safety & Security

**9. Generated Code = Untrusted**
- Review every line — AI misses subtle issues
- Auth, payments, permissions, secrets: line-by-line
- Least privilege for tools
- Never add secrets to code/tests/logs/docs

**10. Human-in-the-Loop**
- Stop and ask on ambiguity — don't assume
- Bypass mode only after plan approval
- Read-only DB access via MCP for debugging

### Documentation

**11. Docs = Part of Feature**
- Update README/docs: what changed, how to run/test
- Maintain tech debt list for postponed items
- Use linters, type checks, static analysis

**12. Task Specs > Vague Prompts**
Non-trivial changes need mini-spec:
- Current state → Problem → Desired state
- Files changing, acceptance criteria

### Architecture

**13. Monorepo & Standards**
- Monorepos for unified frontend/backend context
- Popular, well-documented library versions
- Keep unrelated logic separate
- Skill files for reusable patterns

**14. Parallel Work**
- Only when tasks clearly separated and base stable
- Merge in small, tested chunks
