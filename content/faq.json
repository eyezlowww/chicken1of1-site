    "question": "What is a card break?",
    "answer": "A card break or unboxing is where boxes or cases of trading cards are opened live on stream. Participants buy spots (teams, divisions, serial #, or players) and receive the cards that correspond to their purchase. Breaking is a FUN way to grow your collection, but it isn't the financially smartest way to grow your collection."

Research how to comp (check current price) cards, by using 130point.com or cardladder.com.\n\nLearn how to read a product checklist, practice with mmarookies.com or checklistinsider.com.\n\nLearn how to properly topload and store your cards. Find best practices for shipping your cards.\n\nSet a budget! Spending more doesn't equate to more fun or a better collection. Avoid FOMO."

  },
  {
    "question": "Can I get a refund if I'm not happy with my cards?",
