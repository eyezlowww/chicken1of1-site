    "question": "What is a card break?",
    "answer": "A card break or unboxing is where boxes or cases of trading cards are opened live on stream. Participants buy spots (teams, divisions, serial #, or players) and receive the cards that correspond to their purchase. Breaking is a FUN way to grow your collection, but it isn't the financially smartest way to grow your collection."

Find best practices for shipping your cards.\n\nSet a budget! Spending more doesn't equate to more fun or a better collection. Avoid FOMO."
